Odoo Connector WooCommerce Module
=================================
*Odoo WooCommerce Connector (also known as connector_woocommerce) is a bi-directional connector, compatible with the Odoo 10.0 and WooCommerce 3.4.2).*

Forked from OCA/connector-woocommerce, which is unworkable after the **Odoo Connector** have been rewriter in the end of 2017.
I have no idea why this module didn't update after March 28 2017. Anyway, I modify the codes and this module is working now.
